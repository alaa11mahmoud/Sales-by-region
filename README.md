# Overview
I created a four-page dashboard to study sales for a group of products and compare them to profits for each country, as well as to study the performance of sellers and their profits. The data source was Excel.
The dashboard pages were linked through interactive buttons for easy navigation. The charts provided a comprehensive picture of sales in each country compared to profits over the months, as well as the profit percentage, sales of each product, and the performance of sellers. This facilitated easy reading and analysis of the situation and helped in decision-making.

# Key KPIs
- Total sales and profits for each region
- Comparison of sales and profits by region
- Tracking the performance of each sales manager
- Sales volume and profits for each product category
- Monthly trends in revenue and profits
- Which regions generate the highest profits?
- Which managers contribute the most to the company's success?
- How do product sales translate into profits?
- And how does performance change over time?
